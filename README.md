# tauri-plugin-egui

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** ðŸš§

This plugin offers a simple way to render some `egui` UI in a Tauri Window (alongside or without a Webview).

## Design / Architecture

1. Uses `egui`, `egui-wgpu` and `wgpu` dependencies
2. Expose some traits on Tauri's `Window`/`WebviewWindow` to set up `egui` context
3. Keeps "bridge" code as minimal as possible

## Development Guide

1. Most plugin source code is in `src/lib.rs` and `src/renderer.rs`
2. The API example usage is in `examples/vanilla/src-tauri/src/main.rs`
3. check all the rust code with `cargo check`
4. run the example app with `bun tauri dev` in the `examples/vanilla` directory

## Progress

- [x] create example app to explore API design
- [x] set up egui context
- [x] make gpu surface and connect to window
- [x] render a basic egui UI
- [x] add support for webview windows
- [ ] handle basics like input events, resizing, etc.
- [ ] make rendering backend (wgpu) swappable for glow, etc.


## Goals

For one of my Tauri apps, I needed to render `egui` in certain windows. As of today, other methods are either outdated/unmaintained or require too much boilerplate code.
